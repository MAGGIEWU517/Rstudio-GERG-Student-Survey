#Further Analysis List
# (Jared) Fix the G.N tech issue  and make distributions to those compostie variables (Done)
# (Patrick) created 5 composite variables for personality  (Done)
# (Joss) corrlation table 
# (Jared) regression analysis for all variables of those two surveys


# (Joss) more discussion about composite distribution 
# (Joss) Look carefully about Decision_4 
# 
# (Patrick)Write a function to report a correlation with one line of text: only two significant digits (no leading zero), 
#   stars for significance (* p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001) and 95% confidence interval in square brackets (again, two digits, no leading zero).
# (Patrick)For important correlations, report a scatter plot, with correlation line.
# (Patrick)When a variable in a correlation has a very skewed distribution (as we saw before) create a new binary variable based on a median split (add .split to the variable name). 
#   Report the split: what the split point is, how many in each category (you may need to adjust the split point slightly to have a more equal balance between halves). Then report correlation with that binary variable.
# (Patrick) Ignore unimportant correlation

# (Patrick)If comparing the levels of two measures (e.g. same question in two surveys) report a t-test, again with significance, 95% CI, and also effect size (Cohen's d);
#   good to write a function to have this on one line of text.
# (Joss )Mannâ€“Whitney U test
